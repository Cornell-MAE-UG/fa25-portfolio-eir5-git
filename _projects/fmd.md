In the fluid mechanical dissection video, I edited the video. Since our group had five people we arranged the five minute video to have a minute of each of us speaking. During the dissection I recorded key parts of the engine that tie into our video. We would move the choke valve for example to highlight in our video so that I could overlay images of the dissection over the videos of us explaining the engine.
